Imaging (WSI) which allows for high-resolution scanning of complete 
histological slides. For ease of analysis, these WSI files are often too 
large and as a result require effective handling and processing 
approaches. During our initial steps in analyzing ameloblastic whole slide 
images, we generate WSI file tiles using the OpenSlide library for 
managing and extracting regions from huge histopathological pictures. 
 
OpenSlide library is loaded correctly, especially on Windows systems 
where the DLL directory must be specified. In case of need, this 
configuration ensures compatibility with the Windows OS through 
adding the OpenSlide DLL directory to the system path. This is needed to 
allow access to OpenSlide functionality without running into problems 
with loading libraries. 
 
Thereafter, a slide object loads a WSI file so that region extraction and 
subsequent processing can be performed on it later on. Using 
OpenSlide's `open_slide` function, a TIFF formatted WSI file is loaded. 
 
The part of interest is extracted and processed. This involves 
normalization and separation into Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) 
components. Extract a 1024x1024 pixel region from position (16000, 
16000) at the highest resolution level (level 0). Then normalize the 
extracted region, and compute its H&E images with a `norm_hne` 
function. 
 
The script also contains an option to detect and handle blank or low-
information tiles through use of pixel value statistics. It computes the 
average as well as standard deviation in each image in a given list which 
helps us to find those slides that have no information enough e.g., blank 
slides. 
 
DeeperZoomGenerator from OpenSlide, on the other hand, implements 
essential tiling functionalities that efficiently generate image tiles in 
multiple level scales. The code creates an object of DeepZoomGenerator 
with slide by setting 2048-pixel tile size without overlapping. This 
generator has multi-resolution access to the slide enabling hierarchical 
tiling. 
The script at the end of the analysis, iterates through the generated tiles 
and saves them locally after processing. The tiles are pulled out at level 
17, they are changed to RGB format and saved as high quality JPEG 
images. One can consider including normalization or other image 
techniques during this process before saving the tiles. 
 
OpenSlide is a popular library used for managing digital slide data, which 
provides mechanisms for performing operations such as reading the 
summary information of a slide or extracting a region from a slide. For 
example, large histological images on slides can be divided into smaller 
portions referred to as “tiles” using OpenSlide library. The 
`DeepZoomGenerator` is an efficient way to handle WSI data making it 
suitable for high-throughput pathological image analysis projects.
